Once the nurse log in to the application, the nurse can see the list of patients in her care as indicated above. The lists are color coded to indicate if the patients have overdue prescriptions or not. Green is if the patient has no overdue prescriptions, while yellow shows that the patient has prescriptions to be passed in the hour. Red indicates that the patient has one or more overdue prescriptions.

When a given patient is selected, the nurse can see the list of medications along with dose and time. The nurse can then select the medication that needs to be given or not. Once the medication is passed to the patient, the nurse clicks on save which changes the color.
